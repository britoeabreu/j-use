# j-use
Java programming facade to the USE tool

## Introduction
J-USE is a programming facade (API) that allows any Java program to interact with the USE tool. This API has been used as a middleware component of several research projects such as:
* the [M2DM (Metamodel Driven Measurement tool)](https://github.com/quasarresearchgroup/m2dm), an Eclipse plugin for Java metrics formalization and collection
* the [J-USE for Android](https://github.com/quasarresearchgroup/j-use), a model-driven Eclipse plugin for generating Android BIS apps
* the [use2java (UML Specification Environment models to Java)](https://github.com/quasarresearchgroup/use2java), a Java code generator for UML class models expressed with the [USE tool](http://useocl.sourceforge.net/w/index.php/Main_Page).
